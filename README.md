# TripStory

**Final project for<br />
ECE 1778 - Creative Applications for Mobile Devices<br />
University of Toronto**

## Description
The aim of the project- ‘Trip Story’ is to create a Rebus Story (picture story) App that allows children to form their personalized stories by answering a series of questions. These questions are designed to be engaging and test the user’s (children age: 4+) creativity. The App provides a platform for the child to create their own stories with assistance from the parent. Upon making the correct selection, the story would continue and finally the story formed will be portrayed in the form of a Rebus story.
The ‘Rebus story’ concept aims to promote early literacy by motivating children to participate in storytelling while also improving cognitive skills. The App thus caters to preschool children in improving their cognitive and literacy skills and is a useful asset in the field of education. The preschool years are a signiﬁcant period of pre-reading development, in which children establish foundational skills in the areas of language (e.g., vocabulary, grammar) and literacy (e.g. print knowledge, phonological awareness) because pre-schooler’s language and literacy skills are critically related to later academic success. The App makes reading fun, entertaining, and help children develop a love of reading. The App aims at providing children with a path to create their own stories and personalize it so as to make it engaging. Decision making, speech development and early reading skills, are primary aspects of this App. The App is built on the premise of providing beginning readers, the thrill of learning or creating a story which builds confidence and supports them on their way to independence and becoming self-learners and inquirers. Learning to make their own choices helps children be more independent, responsible, and confident, so decision-making is a good skill to develop at an early stage. The famous psychologist Piaget states that children are "little scientists," actively trying to make sense of the world rather than simply soaking up information passively. Their mind is thus stimulated as they think and question through their options while creating their personalised stories. Children who particularly need to develop literacy skills can really improve and gain confidence and interest in reading using this App. Images, animations, pictures and colours fascinate children and thus a typical child’s story book has big images and very few words. The child can learn to read by identifying their selected pictures in the App as cues as they read along with the parent. Viewing the glossary after each story can reinforce literacy and they can learn the words which adds to the educational value. Parental involvement is another important feature of the App that contributes to a child’s learning and development. Children with parents who are involved in their education and learning tend to have fewer behavioural problems and better academic performance and more likely to complete high school than children whose parents are not involved in their learning process and schooling. Moreover positive feedback from parents encourages children to repeat good behaviour and motivates them to learn more. The App is therefore an enriching tool that nurtures preschool children to simply enjoy reading, learning, thinking, being confident about their capabilities and encourage them to learn more.<br />
